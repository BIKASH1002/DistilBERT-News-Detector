# Fake News Detector: DistilBERT-Based News Classification

# Overview

This project showcases the development of a Fake News Detector using DistilBERT, a lightweight LLM model. The model is trained to classify news articles as either Real or Fake, achieving high accuracy and excellent performance metrics. This repository also demonstrates the use of Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library and Weights & Biases (WandB) for experiment tracking, ensuring a reproducible and well-documented workflow.
