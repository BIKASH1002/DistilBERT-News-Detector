# Fake News Detector: DistilBERT-Based News Classification

## Content

## Overview

This project showcases the development of a Fake News Detector using DistilBERT, a lightweight LLM model. The model is trained to classify news articles as either Real or Fake, achieving high accuracy and excellent performance metrics. This repository also demonstrates the use of Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library and Weights & Biases (WandB) for experiment tracking, ensuring a reproducible and well-documented workflow.

## Features

- **Binary Text Classification:** Identify whether a news article is real or fake.
  
- **DistilBERT Fine-tuning:** Lightweight and efficient version of BERT used for training.

- **Experiment Tracking with WandB:** Real-time logging of metrics and model performance.

- **Visualizations:** Confusion matrix, classification report, and loss trends plotted to analyze model behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset can be accessed from Kaggle. It consist of following files: 

- **Training Data:** Labeled dataset containing news articles with corresponding real or fake labels.

- **Test Data:** Unlabeled dataset used for generating predictions.
